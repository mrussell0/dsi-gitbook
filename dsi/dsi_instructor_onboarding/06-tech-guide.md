# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) DSI: Tech Guide


The following is an overview of the technologies used in this class, the tech policies we relay to students, and some strategies for deploying these tools during the start of your course.


## Required Tools

Your local admissions/production team should [provide students with the following document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10MQB-CR_IQl3-z1HpxGKCrScKb94uj53FvQkssX9KBw/edit?usp=sharing), which includes a list of the required technologies for this class as well as our laptop policy:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - We will be using Anaconda as our primary development environment
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - We will be using Python & its packages as our primary language
* [Github](http://github.com) - We’ll be using Github on a daily basis to store and share our code
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - You will also need to install and configure command line tools for Git
* [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) - We’ll be using Postgres for local SQL-based data storage
* [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/) is a popular dashboard creation system for visualizing data.
* [Slack](http://slack.com) - We’ll be using Slack on a daily basis to communicate with each other

> Note: Tableau license keys will be provided. Talk to your local production team for details on how to acquire license keys for you and your students. [More information can be found here](https://generalassembly.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=28378131).

## Additional Tools
These tools aren't specifically required, but are highly recommended!

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) are popular text editors for writing scripts to process data, perform analysis, and create visualizations.
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is Google's popular web browser, and comes with a complete set of developer tools built-in.
* [Import.io](https://www.import.io/): a useful web scraping tool with a graphic interface.
* [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly): a user-friendly tool for plotting graphs.


## Commonly Used Python Libraries
Anaconda bundles most of the Python packages we’ll be using in this course, including:
- Python 2.7: One language to rule them all!
- Ipython / Jupyter Notebooks & Pandas: Core tools for creating data science notebooks & analyzing data.
- Matplotlib: The king of all python plotting packages.
- Gensim: Framework for vector modeling.
- NLTK & Spacy: Used for natural language processing.
- NumPy: Array processing tool.
- Scikit-learn: Modules for machine learning & data modeling.
- SciPy: Scientific library for python.
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualizer.
- Pip & Setuptools: package installer & version manager (Mac only).
- PyMC: common stats tool for simulation and optimization.
- Sqlite: Standalone, lightweight SQL database engine.
- Statsmodels: Simple statistical computation (used with SciPy).

## Technology in the Classroom

The following is GA's policy on operating system compatibility that you can share/enforce with your students as needed.

#### Laptop Policy
Most practicing data scientists choose a Unix-type operating system, typically either Apple's OS X or a popular linux distribution such as [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). The instructional team will be leading this course using Mac laptops.

We **strongly recommend** limiting students to the use of Mac laptops. Our instructors can *only offer active support for students using Macs*. Any students with PCs will be required to use a Linux Ubuntu VM to emulate a Unix environment and agree to provide all their own troubleshooting. See our [Installfest Guide](../02-student-onboarding/installfest-lesson/) for more details.

#### System Requirements
Student machines should be running with administrator permissions and have at least 10-20+ gb of free disk space. We also recommend that students use a laptop with a 13-inch screen or larger in order to do their best work. In our experience, students with an 11-inch screen have a harder time in class.

## Operating Systems Policy

- **Mac:** We require students using Mac laptops to use Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or greater in order to run all of the programs necessary for the course. This rules out some older MacBooks versions (circa 2006-2007).

- **Linux:** We allow students to use (Debian-based) Linux **only** if they are previously familiar with it and express understanding (in writing) that we will not generally be able to support them with technical issues or anomalies that they may encounter between their Linux environment and our Mac environment.
 - If a student *has previous experience with Linux* and is willing to provide their own IT support, then we [provide instructions to install Ubuntu](../02-student-onboarding/installfest-lesson/) and its built-in Unity desktop, which is similar to the Mac OS X interface.

- **Windows:** *We do NOT allow students to use Windows during DSI. Students should NOT be allowed to arrive on the first day of class with a Windows PC unless they have installed the Linux Ubuntu VM during Installfest.*

## Platforms, Tools, and Applications

This course teaches students how to be Data Scientists. The field is constantly evolving, and every problem has many solutions. These solutions can be implemented using a variety of tools. A broad introduction to all possible tools would be impossible for a single course; however, we have committed to focusing on the best possible tools and platforms for our students, derived from our baseline learning objectives.

These core objectives, along with instructional guidelines, are provided to help ensure students reach these objectives. Our guidelines include recommendations on the sequence and implementation of software platforms, tools, and applications that serve as the current global baseline.

However, as an instructor, you have the opportunity and responsibility to work with your local team to adapt these recommendations to your local context and help your students achieve these core competencies. If you believe that any of the technologies used by the baseline curriculum is deprecated, obsolete, or needs to be updated for any reason, please feel free to modify your materials accordingly. In addition, let us know so we can adjust the baseline materials by submitting a pull request or logging an issue.

Read up on our [contributing guidelines](../../contributing.md) for more details.
