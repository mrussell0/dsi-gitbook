Week 8 | 3.2

## Introduction

> Note: This will be a very open ended lab, since everyone may end up using different geographies and starting seed geographies. Be prepared to walk around and hand-hold some people, I've tested this out on several locales around me and it works, for most, but if you don't have a good starting seed location, the procedure may not scrape well.

Today's lab is going to get your hands dirty with respect to the Foursquare API. We're also going to build a simple crawler/scraper that will go through the JSON hierarchy, extract the data we want, and deposit them into a Pandas table so we can do simple analysis.

Just in case you're unfamiliar with this concept, please refer to the Wikipedia page (it's actually pretty good): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping, and maybe spend a few moments discussing the concepts and how it could help you in the future as a data scientist to have this "hackish" skill.


## Exercise

Today's lab will start by having you access the foursquare API via Python.

 - You will have to traverse real foursquare data
 - Understand where the data is located in the JSON structure, and how to get at it
 - How to iteratively build your Pandas data frame from the JSON data for further analysis

```python
import foursquare
import json
import pandas as pd
import unicodedata


#ACCESS_TOKEN = ""
#client = foursquare.Foursquare(access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN)

CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR CODE HERE'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR CODE HERE'
client = foursquare.Foursquare(client_id=CLIENT_ID, client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET)
```


#### Requirements

- Understand how to traverse JSON data
- Understand how to utilize dictionaries data types, array types, and other useful Python containers
- Novice facility with foursquare APIs via reading the Foursquare API docs


#### Starter code

Please utilize the starter code found in the directory to start the students on today's activities
[starter code](./code/w8-3.2-starter.ipynb).

> [Solution Code](./code/w8-3.2-solutions.ipynb)

#### Deliverable

Submit a notebook with the code written to complete the exercises!
