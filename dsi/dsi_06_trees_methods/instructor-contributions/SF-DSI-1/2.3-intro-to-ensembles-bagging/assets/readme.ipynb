    "### Ensembles\n",
    "Ensemble techniques are supervised learning methods to improve predictive accuracy by combining several base models in order to enlarge the space of possible hypothesis to represent our data. Ensembles are often much more accurate than the base classifiers that compose them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Short discussion:\n",
    "- when this might be useful? \n",
    "- can you think of a business case where we may want to get a very very accurate model (despite it being more complex)\n",
    "> Answer: for example when lives are at stake or the outcome of an error is very costly:\n",
    "    - medical data models\n",
    "    - failure in airplane engines\n",
    "    - etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two families of ensemble methods are usually distinguished:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In averaging methods, the driving principle is to build several estimators independently and then to average their predictions. On average, the combined estimator is usually better than any of the single base estimator because its variance is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of this family include Bagging methods and Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The other family of ensemble methods are boosting methods, where base estimators are built sequentially and one tries to reduce the bias of the combined estimator. The motivation is to combine several weak models to produce a powerful ensemble. We will discuss these in a future lecture.\n",
    "\n",

    "### The Hypotesis space\n",
    "\n",
    "In any supervised learning task, our goal is to make predictions of the true classification function $f$ by learning the classifier $h$. In other words we are searching in a certain hypothesis space for the most appropriate function to describe the relationship between our features and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Can you give an example of how this search is performed using one of the classifiers you know?\n",
    "> Answer: e.g. in logistic regression we have a space of all possible logistic functions. The best hypothesis is found by choosing the value of the parameters that maximize the accuracy of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** What reasons could be preventing our hypothesis to reach perfect score?\n",
    "> Answer: the problems below\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be several reasons why a base classifier doesn't perform terribly well in trying to approximate the true classification function. These are of three types:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The statistical problem\n",
    "If the amount of training data available is small, the base classifier will have difficulty converging to $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ensemble classifier can mitigate this problem by \"averaging out\" base classifier predictions to improve convergence. This can be pictorially represented as a search in a space where multiple partial perspectives are combined to obtain a better picture of the goal.\n",

    "The true function $f$ is best approximated as an average of the base classifiers.\n",

    "#### The computational Problem\n",
    "Even with sufficient training data, it may still be computationally difficult to find the best classifier $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our base classifier is a decision tree, an exhaustive search of the hypothesis space of all possible classifiers is extremely complex (NP-complete).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact this is why we used a heuristic algorithm (greedy search).\n",
    "\n",
    "An ensemble composed of several _Base Classifiers_’s with different starting points can provide a better approximation to $f$ than any individual _Base Classifiers_.\n",

    "\n",
    "The true function $f$ is often best approximated by using several starting points to explore the hypothesis space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** How would you re-phrase the computational problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The representational Problem\n",
    "Sometimes $f$ cannot be expressed in terms of our hypothesis at all. To illustrate this, suppose we use a decision tree as our base classifier. A decision tree works by forming a rectilinear partition of the feature space, i.e it always cuts at a fixed value along a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Decision Tree boundary](./assets/images/dtcut.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if $f$ is a diagonal line?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it cannot be represented by finitely many rectilinear segments, and therefore the true decision boundary cannot be obtained by a decision tree classifier.\n",

    "## Introduction: Bagging (10 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Bagging or bootstrap aggregating_ is a method that involves manipulating the training set by resampling. We learn $k$ base classifiers on $k$ different samples of training data.  These samples are independently created by resampling the training data using uniform weights (eg, a uniform sampling distribution). In other words each model in the ensemble votes with equal weight. In order to promote model variance, bagging trains each model in the ensemble using a randomly drawn subset of the training set. As an example, the random forest algorithm combines random decision trees with bagging to achieve very high classification accuracy.\n",

    "|Training set 4|4|5|1|4|6|4|3|8|\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a standard training set $D$ of size $n$, bagging generates $m$ new training sets $D_i$, each of size $n′$, by sampling from $D$ uniformly and with replacement. By sampling with replacement, some observations may be repeated in each $D_i$. The $m$ models are fitted using the above $m$ samples and combined by averaging the output (for regression) or voting (for classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging reduces the variance in our generalization error by aggregating multiple base classifiers together (provided they satisfy our earlier requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the base classifier is stable, then the ensemble error is primarily due to bc bias, and bagging may not be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each sample of training data is equally likely, bagging is not very susceptible to overfitting with noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As they provide a way to reduce overfitting, bagging methods work best with strong and complex models (e.g., fully developed decision trees), in contrast with boosting methods which usually work best with weak models (e.g., shallow decision trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Can you propose another sample to add to those above? Call out the numbers you would include.\n",

    "In scikit-learn, bagging methods are offered as a unified `BaggingClassifier` meta-estimator (resp. BaggingRegressor), taking as input a user-specified base estimator along with parameters specifying the strategy to draw random subsets. In particular, max_samples and max_features control the size of the subsets (in terms of samples and features), while bootstrap and bootstrap_features control whether samples and features are drawn with or without replacement.
