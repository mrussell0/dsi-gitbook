## Attendance Policy
During the cohort, General Assembly enforces a strict attendance policy.

* You may only miss two (2) days of class.
* You may only be late three (3) days to class.

#### Daily Checkin

* We will report your attendance daily.
* Attendance will be requested as part of the morning exercise.

#### Let's Communicate

We understand that you have a life to live. If something comes up, please just let us know as a group. Email:

* brad.zimmerman@generalassemb.ly
* steve.geluso@generalassemb.ly


#### Field Trips

Students are required to attend field trips for professional development, networking, and exposure to the software industry.

#### Internships/Apprenticeships

If a student finds work as an apprentice or intern, they may discuss the opportunity with the instructional staff, Jenna and Sarah. If it will not interfere with your classwork, we typically have no problem with you leaving class early. We're here to help you change your career!

#### Approved Absences

* Approved absences do not count against your total missed days.
* These are reserved for emergencies, doctor's appointments, and other important things.
* Chat with an instructor if something comes up. We only share information amongst ourselves and Angie.
