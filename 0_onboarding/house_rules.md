* Treat everyone with respect - your fellow students, front lines staff, instructors, and everyone.
* Always have your laptop ready to be used.
* Clean up after yourselves (don’t leave glasses and coffee mugs out; place dirty dishes in the dishwasher or sink).
* Leave your workspace better than you found it (clean up after yourself).
* Keep the aisles of the classroom clear (no book bags, messenger bags, or purses).
* Don’t slam the door to the classroom if you need to get up and use the bathroom, take a call, etc.
* Utilize the coat rack to hang your jackets up.

* If you would like to use a conference room, please ask an instructor first.
* The fridge is cleaned out every Friday afternoon.
